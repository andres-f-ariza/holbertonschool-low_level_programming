Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
To solve this problem, we need to find the largest palindrome that can be expressed as the product of two 3-digit numbers.

First, let's consider what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome.

To find the largest palindrome that can be expressed as the product of two 3-digit numbers, we can start by generating all possible products of 3-digit numbers and checking each one to see if it is a palindrome. We can do this using a nested loop in a programming language like Python.


largest_palindrome = 0

for i in range(100, 1000):
    for j in range(100, 1000):
            product = i * j
	            if str(product) == str(product)[::-1]: # check if the product is a palindrome
		                if product > largest_palindrome: # check if the palindrome is the largest one found so far
				                largest_palindrome = product

print(largest_palindrome)

This code generates all products of 3-digit numbers and checks each one to see if it is a palindrome. If a palindrome is found, it checks if it is the largest one found so far. The final result is the largest palindrome that was found.

Running this code, we get the output:

906609
