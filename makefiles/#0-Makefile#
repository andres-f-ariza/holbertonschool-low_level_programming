all:
	gcc main.c school.c -o school
/*
*The given code appears to be a Makefile rule that compiles two
*source code files, "main.c" and "school.c", using the gcc
*compiler, and creates an executable binary file named "school".
*In this case, the target is "all", which means
*that running "make all" will execute this rule.
*The dependencies are "main.c" and "school.c", and
*the command is "gcc main.c school.c -o school".
*This rule tells the make utility to compile both
*source code files and link them together into
*an executable file called "school". The "-o"
*option specifies the output file name.
*Overall, this code is a simple example of how
*to use Makefile rules to compile and link a C
*program using the gcc compiler.
