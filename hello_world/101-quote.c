/*The first line of code writes the error message to the
*standard error stream using the write() function. The
*message is enclosed in double quotes and contains a newline
*character (\n) at the end to ensure the message is printed
*on a new line. The STDERR_FILENO constant specifies that
*the message should be written to the standard error stream.
*The second line of code returns an integer value of 1,
*indicating an error occurred. This return value is commonly
*used to indicate a non-zero exit status for the program,
*which can be useful for shell scripts or other programs
*that execute this program as a subprocess.
*In summary, the main() function in this program writes an
*error message to the standard error stream and returns a
*non-zero exit status to indicate an error occurred.
